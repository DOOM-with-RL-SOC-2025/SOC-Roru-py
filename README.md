# Final Project
This repository has the final project for SOC.
The .ipynb file has the step by step code for creating env, training and testing the models.
The log folder has tensorboard files which can be used to view stats while training.
The models folder has 2 trained models over 100k steps which can be imported and used.


Above code has been run in a virtual env created in linux os with the required libraries which are also mentioned in code.

This also has a subproject called Lunar-Lander.
It is Box-2D env and agent is trained without using pytorch or neural netowrks and only using numpy.
